After this incident police concludes she did that to her husband as she went mute and didn\'t reacted to any questions asked. She stayed quiet even after she was sent to forensic unit. <li>(Alicia was a painter. She lived a happy life with her husband until she sees a man frequently standing near their house and when she tells her husband about this, he doesn\'t believe her. Instead, takes her to a psychatrist and gets her medicines) <li>Theo, a forensic psychotherapist, is interested in her case and applies to the unit when an opening appears and successfully gets placed as in charge of Alicia. His father was abusive. He tried to kill himself in college now happily married to Kathy, who he has a passionate, wild and loving relationship with.<li>Although Alicia remains mute during their therapy sessions, she gives Theo her diary. He reads the diary and returns it to Alicia. Meanwhile, He catches Kathy cheating on him. He follows his wife\'s lover and finds out that guy is married. At work, Theo asks Alicia about the whole incident one last time and she finally agrees to speak. She describes how the masked man had a knife, tied her to a chair, and attacked Gabriel when he got home. He tied him up, shot him in the face and left. Theo is skeptical and suspected something.<li>The next day Theo injects her with something which made her feel drowsy. At that moment she was sure that Theo was the mystry man and her previous story was intentionally inaccurate to test his response. Instead, after Theo tied them both up, he revealed Gabriel as a cheater and offered him a choice, either he or Alicia would die. Gabriel chooses Alicia. Theo says ok and shoots a shot straight up. Gabriel thinks she\'s dead but then realizes she\'s ok. Theo unties only Alicia and leaves. Alicia shoots Gabriel.<li> Now go take a nap.
